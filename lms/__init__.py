# We monkey patch Kombu's entrypoints listing because scanning through this
# accounts for the majority of LMS/Studio startup time for tests, and we don't
# use custom Kombu serializers (which is what this is for). Still, this is
# pretty evil, and should be taken out when we update Celery to the next version
# where it looks like this method of custom serialization has been removed.
#
# FWIW, this is identical behavior to what happens in Kombu if pkg_resources
# isn't available.
